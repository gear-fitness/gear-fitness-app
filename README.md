# Gear Fitness

A comprehensive full-stack fitness tracking solution designed to help gym-goers maintain consistency, track progress, and optimize their workout routines.

## About

This project is being developed as part of our Fall 2025 Capstone class by:

- **Kobe Cortez**
- **Bryant Truong**
- **Alton Matovu**
- **Max Lopez**

As dedicated gym-goers ourselves, we experienced firsthand the challenges of maintaining effective workout routines and decided to build a solution that addresses the real pain points we and others face in the gym.

## Problem Statement

Traditional workout tracking methods often fall short in several key areas:

- **Data Accessibility** - Difficulty retrieving historical weight and rep data for specific exercises
- **Progress Management** - Challenges maintaining consistency and determining optimal progression timing
- **Visual Analytics** - Limited options for visualizing fitness progress over time
- **Exercise Guidance** - Uncertainty about proper form when attempting new exercises

## Features

Our application provides a comprehensive suite of tools to enhance your fitness journey:

- ✅ **Workout Sessions** - Start and end workout sessions with ease
- 🔍 **Exercise Search** - Quickly find exercises from an extensive database
- 📊 **Performance Tracking** - Record sets, reps, and weights for each exercise
- 📅 **Workout History** - Review and analyze past workout data
- 🤝 **Social Sharing** - Share your workouts with the community
- 👥 **Community Workouts** - Browse and draw inspiration from other users' shared routines
